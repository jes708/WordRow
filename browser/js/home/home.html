    <h1>Welcome to Word Row!</h1>
    <h3>The rules are simple.</h3>
    <p>Claim 4 consecutive spaces going across, down, or diagonally to win the game!</p>
    <h3>How do you claim a space?</h3>
    <p>Simply click the space you wish to claim, and use the letters in your pot to form a valid word.</p>
    <h3>No space is safe.</h3>
    <p>Any space on the board can be stolen by rearranging all of the letters in that space, and adding at least one letter from your pot, in order to form a new word.</p>
