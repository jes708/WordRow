# WordRow

Live demo coming soon.

### The rules are simple.
Claim 4 consecutive spaces going across, down, or diagonally to win the game!

### How do you claim a space?
Simply click the space you wish to claim, and use the letters in your pot to form a valid word.

### No space is safe.
Any space on the board can be stolen by rearranging all of the letters in that space, and adding at least one letter from your pot, in order to form a new word.
